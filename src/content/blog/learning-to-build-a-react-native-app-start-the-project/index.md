At the start of October 2019 I decided to start learning React Native. Before learning React Native I have being using ReactJS with some of my own project and lately more and more on my work. By learning React Native I wanted to challenge myself to learn some more about React. And I figured that what would be the better way to learn then getting a fresh perspective from a different usage of the technology.

For the past couple of year I have being joggling this idea about a Quiz app. Now and then I tried to take a swing at it, but failed. The time wasn't right because of my sill level or I didn't have the time or energy to spare. Once again I find myself starting this project. This time I have many things on my side. A blog to easily publish my finding and more importantly to publis my ambitions to try this (I was raced so that you have to finish what you started) and have that as my motivation. Also now days I code daily basics and even so I code ReactJs because of my job. So there's an extra motivation there for me to learn more. 

I wrote more about the motivation and what led here at my earlier post titled: <a href="/learning-to-build-a-react-native-app-the-motivation">**Learning to build a React Native App: The Motivation**</a>
