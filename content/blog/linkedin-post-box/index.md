## Keep up training

I'm a front-end developer. So the bread and butter in my daily is to write semantically strong HTML and CSS. Well technically because I work with Typescript, ReactJs and styled-components what I might be writing can be JSX, or TSX or for example styled-component template literals. But the syntax is almost all the same and the results will be html and css. So I'm always trying to improve these cornerstone skills for developer.

I started this series so that I can create a easy template for me to publish some doodles that I'm used writing now and then.
The code itself is written to awesome <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a> and as you can see embeded to posts like below.

Here's a reference screenshot that I snapped from LinkedIn feed. Note that this is not a actual post but an edit I photoshopped to serve this example.

And here's the embedded CodePen that I created
