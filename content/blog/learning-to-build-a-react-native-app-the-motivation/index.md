## Start with Why

On last sunday I tooked a glance on software framework called Electron. For those who don't know:
<a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a> is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is an open-source framework developed and maintained by GitHub that allows developers to write desktop GUI applications. As it happens my co-workers use Electron on their project. I wondered if I should take a swing at it just for funs, after all that could be somehow beneficial later on. 

But as it happens one starter repo and few hello-worlds later I wasn't so sure about my reasoning anymore. Don't get me wrong the Electron itself sounded and looked great, but the fact that it's used to write GUI apps for Windows, Mac and Linux just did not stir up any enthusiasm in me. Not a very good sign when it comes to passion projects. So I started thinking what would work for me the best. Enters: React Native.

For the past year I have being working with more and more with ReactJs and I like the framework. So I figured out that learning <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a> would be a great way to deepen my undertanding about the framework while learning more about what React has to offer on other kind of format. After all as it says in their side _React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ...You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch._

Few year back I had a idea about a simple quiz app. I even sketched out some visualisation and gave it a try codewise. But it never took off properly. I decided that the end of the year I would focus my off work coding to learning React Native. Udemy happened to have their once every other week megasales on so I bought Maximilian Schwarzmüllers course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/" target="_blank">_React Native - The Practical Guide_</a> as a learning material.

## Then How

The next day when I was commuting to work on a buss watching the newly purchased course I wondered when I would have the time to see this project through. I also have the once again started blog and tons of stuff to code at work. How could I make it more appealing for myself to commit to a yet another thing. And then it it came to me. I'll make a series of blog post documenting the project and about the progress. 

## What happens next

Well that's a good question. I think I want to make a proper plan that can be then executed. I have the idea and some visuals already so I get them documented and then see what the _minimum viable product_ would be. After that it should be fairly easy. Just code.
